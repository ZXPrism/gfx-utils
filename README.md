# gfx-utils
Simple graphics utils based on OpenGL for my own gfx experiments (also for yours).

## Getting Started

### Examples
1. Install [xmake](https://xmake.io/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Make sure your PC have at least one C++ compiler (should support **C++20**) installed and it's on the PATH.
4. Open terminal at root folder of the repo, execute `xmake -a`.
5. You can find the example binaries under `./bin/examples` folder.

#### Gallery *(TODO)*
- [create_ window](./examples/create_window.cpp)
- [texture io](./examples/texture_io.cpp)
- [multiple render targets (mrt)](./examples/mrt.cpp)
- [compute shaders](./examples/compute.cpp)
- [post processing](./examples/post_processing.cpp)

### Development & Contribute
<!-- It's recommended to use VSCode.

1. Install [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) (for VSCode, you can simply install the clangd extension) -->
